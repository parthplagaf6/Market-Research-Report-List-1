<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-Duty Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty pumps market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal pumps and positive-displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluid, making them ideal for applications requiring high flow rates and consistent pressure. They are commonly used in water, wastewater, and chemical processing. In contrast, positive-displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, providing high pressure and efficiency, making them suitable for viscous fluids and precise metering applications.</p></p>
