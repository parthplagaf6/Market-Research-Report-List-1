<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Iodide Contrast Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li><li>Nonionic Dimers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organic iodide contrast agents market consists of three primary types: ion type, non-ionic type, and non-ionic dimers. Ion type agents contain iodine in ionic form, promoting high osmolality but potentially causing adverse reactions. Non-ionic type agents are characterized by lower osmolality and reduced side effects, making them safer for patients. Non-ionic dimers further enhance safety and efficacy by having a larger molecular structure, which results in even lower osmotic pressure and improved imaging quality while minimizing discomfort.</p></p>
