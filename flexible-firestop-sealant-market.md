<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Firestop Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flexible firestop sealant market comprises primarily two types: elastomeric and intumescent. Elastomeric sealants remain flexible after curing, allowing them to effectively accommodate movement and provide long-lasting seals in various construction applications. In contrast, intumescent sealants provide passive fire protection by expanding when exposed to heat, forming a char that seals off openings and prevents fire spread. Both types are essential for enhancing fire safety in buildings, ensuring compliance with regulations while protecting assets and lives from fire hazards.</p></p>
