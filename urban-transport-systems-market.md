<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urban Transport Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-rapid Transport Systems</li><li>Rapid Transport Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urban transport systems can be categorized into semi-rapid and rapid transport systems. Semi-rapid transport includes modes like trams and light rail, which operate at higher speeds than traditional public transport but share road space, leading to variable journey times. Rapid transport systems, such as metros and subways, are designed for high-capacity, fast movement, often with dedicated tracks that minimize delays. Both types aim to enhance urban mobility, reduce congestion, and provide efficient alternatives to private vehicles in densely populated areas.</p></p>
